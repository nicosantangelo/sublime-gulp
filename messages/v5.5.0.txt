Hello!

** Windows users **

The way `Gulp: Kill running tasks` works changed a bit.

The path to the `taskkill` executable (used to...well kill tasks) changed in this version to make it work in Windows 10.

If you were experiencing problems (not being able to kill tasks) it should be working now.
If you encounter any new problems, please let me know at https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp/issues

Thanks a lot to @atnartur for finding and fixing the issue.

That is all,
thank you!
